The total number of months included in the dataset.
1. finances.length 

The net total amount of Profit/Losses over the entire period.
1. add up all the numbers, array finances[0][1], finances[1][2]

4.total  = total ++ finances[i][1]

(Total/Number of months)



The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period.


The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period.


When you open your code in the browser your resulting analysis should look similar to the following:
